# cnn-implementations

I attempted to attempt some Kaggle competitions and my scrips are uploaded here. I try to code with increasing complexity with each attempt

CNN_on_the_cloud - this allowed me to initalize and run a complete model with training on the cloud - I used google compute engine because they gave me credits for free

mnist digits classifer - this is often considered as the "hello world" of deep learning. I used a basic CNN here. pretty cool accuracy 

cats_dogs_CNN - I attempted transfer learning here by taking the first 10 layers from VGG16 imagenet and then training a fully connected last layers. 
My model basically overfits (train accuracy ~99% and validation accuracy ~ 85%). comments to improve are welcome 


what am i working on next? Semantic segmentation!
